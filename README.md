Point Adder is a really simple eclipse project made for storing any ammount of points

# Setup
1. Download [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/).

2. Create a `Program Files` folder in your `D` Drive, in it create a `Point Adder` folder and in that create `points.txt` file
  - the **_Default_** file Location should be `D:/Program Files/Point Adder/points.txt`
  - You can change the location **_Manually_** on line **_31_** in `sysTrayCounter.java`

3. **_Import_** these files into Eclipse

# Features
- Storing **_data_** to a **_File_** on the computer
- Running in the **_System Tray_**
